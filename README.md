The distance estimation of objects from a single camera can play a crucial role in many real-life applications, such as mobile robot navigation, autonomous vehicles and camera-based assistive devices for visually impaired people. This paper addresses the problem of distance estimation of people from a monocular camera. The paper proposes using various regression algorithms with face size, beside body size, considered as features to estimate the distance from a camera.
